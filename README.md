# ucl_final_project

This is the repository used for my final project. My objective is to compare how the traditional solution of the lifecycle program, obtained using dynamic programming, compare to that of a reinforcement learning agent.

In the dynamic_programming folder I recreate and solve the problem using dynamic programming.

In the reinforcement folder I solve the problem training an agent.

A few test* notebooks are used the explore.
